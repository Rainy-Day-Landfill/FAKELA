# FakeLA

This is my "ground zero" for some new tools I'm learning marked in **bold**.

- **Filebeat**
- Apache
- **Kibana**
- **Elasticsearch**
- Linux
- **Ansible**

FakeLA should serve as a "Log Aggregation and Data Analytics In a Box" when it's done.

It currently props up all services but requires some in application setup to get going.
